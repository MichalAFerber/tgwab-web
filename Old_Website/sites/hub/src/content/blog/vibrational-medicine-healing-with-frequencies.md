For centuries, cultures around the world have used sound and vibration for healing — from Tibetan singing bowls and Gregorian chants to tuning forks and drumming circles. Today, vibrational medicine explores how specific sound frequencies may help balance the body, mind, and spirit.

This post introduces the concept of vibrational healing, provides a detailed frequency chart for various conditions, and guides you in building your own Raspberry Pi tone generator. We’ve also included both an **online frequency tone generator** and a **free downloadable tone library** so you can start experimenting right away.

## What Is Vibrational Medicine?

Vibrational medicine works on the principle that every cell, organ, and system in the body has its own natural frequency. When these frequencies are disrupted — by stress, injury, or illness — it may be possible to encourage a return to balance using matching or harmonic sound waves.

Modern research into bioresonance and sound therapy is still developing, but many practitioners and individuals report benefits from targeted frequency exposure.

## Frequency Chart for Common Conditions

Below is a list of suggested frequencies used in vibrational healing. These are based on anecdotal and alternative medicine sources, not mainstream medical consensus.

| Condition | Frequency Range (Hz) |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Acne | 10–15 |
| Allergies | 5–10 |
| Alzheimer’s Disease | 2–8 |
| Angina | 2–8 |
| Anxiety | 2–8 |
| Arrhythmia | 7–8 |
| Arteriosclerosis | 7–10 |
| Asthma | 7–10 or 12–15 |
| Blepharitis (Chronic) | 1–2 |
| Bronchitis | Acute: 4, Chronic: 12 |
| Bruises | 10–14 |
| Carpal Tunnel Syndrome | 6 or 20 |
| Cervical Vertebra Pain | 15–20 |

| Toothache | 1–3 |
| Tinnitus | 2–8 |
| Ulcers | 2–4 |
| Varicose Veins | 8–10 |
| Wound Healing | 6–12 |

## How to Use Frequencies

People apply these tones in several ways:

- **Meditation** — Playing tones during mindfulness practice.  
- **Focused Sessions** — Using headphones or speakers aimed toward specific areas of the body.  
- **Background Therapy** — Low-volume playback during daily activities.  

| **Disclaimer:**
| This is not a substitute for medical treatment. Always consult a qualified healthcare provider before starting any therapy.

## DIY Raspberry Pi Tone Generator

Want a hands-on way to generate healing frequencies? You can build a dedicated tone generator using a Raspberry Pi.

### Hardware Needed

- Raspberry Pi (any model, Pi Zero 2W or Pi 4 recommended)
- microSD card (8GB+)
- Power supply
- External speaker or headphones

### Software Setup

1. Install Raspberry Pi OS (Lite is fine).
2. Update your system:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

3. Install Python audio library:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip
pip3 install numpy sounddevice
```

4. Sample Python Script

```python
import numpy as np
import sounddevice as sd

def play_tone(frequency, duration=5, volume=0.5):
    fs = 44100  # Sample rate
    t = np.linspace(0, duration, int(fs*duration), endpoint=False)
    waveform = volume * np.sin(2 * np.pi * frequency * t)
    sd.play(waveform, fs)
    sd.wait()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    freq = float(input("Enter frequency in Hz: "))
    play_tone(freq, duration=10)
```

Save this as `tone_generator.py` and run:

```bash
python3 tone_generator.py
```

## Final Thoughts

Sound has a profound effect on the human experience. Whether you approach vibrational medicine as a scientific curiosity, a spiritual practice, or a relaxing background aid, exploring these frequencies can be an enriching journey.
