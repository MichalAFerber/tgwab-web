This guide will walk you through building a **low-cost, standalone frequency generator** using a Raspberry Pi and a small speaker or vibration module. Perfect for exploring bioresonant healing, vibrational medicine, or simple experiments in sound therapy.

## 🧰 What You’ll Need

### 🪛 Hardware

- **Raspberry Pi** (any model; Zero 2W or Pi 3/4 recommended)
- **microSD Card** (8GB or larger)
- **Speaker** (USB or 3.5mm AUX, or small amplifier with tactile transducer for sub-20 Hz use)
- **Internet connection** for setup (Ethernet or Wi-Fi)

### 💻 Software

- Raspberry Pi OS (Lite or Full)
- Python 3 (pre-installed)
- Optional: SSH access or monitor + keyboard

## ⚙️ Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Flash and Boot Raspberry Pi OS

- Use [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) to install Raspberry Pi OS onto the microSD card.
- Boot the Pi and complete initial setup (or enable SSH headlessly if using Lite).

### 2. Connect Audio Output

- Plug in a **3.5mm speaker**, USB speaker, or use HDMI audio.
- Test with:

```bash
speaker-test -t sine -f 440
```

(ctrl+c to stop)

### 3. Install Python Audio Tools

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3-pip
pip3 install numpy sounddevice
```

### 4. Create the Tone Generator Script

Save this as `tone_gen.py`:

```python
import numpy as np
import sounddevice as sd
import time

frequency = float(input("Enter frequency (Hz): "))
duration = float(input("Enter duration (seconds): "))
samplerate = 44100

t = np.linspace(0, duration, int(samplerate * duration), False)
tone = 0.5 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * frequency * t)

print(f"Playing {frequency} Hz for {duration} seconds...")
sd.play(tone, samplerate)
sd.wait()
```

### 5. Run It

```bash
python3 tone_gen.py
```

Enter a frequency like `10` and duration like `30`, and it will play.

## 🧘‍♀️ Optional: Use Vibration for Sub-20 Hz Healing

Human ears can’t hear below 20 Hz well — but your **body can feel it**.

### Upgrade Options

- **Tactile transducer** (e.g., Dayton BST-1)
- **Low-pass filtered amplifier**
- Attach to chair, bed, yoga mat, or under desk

## 🌀 Bonus: Auto-Play Sequence

You can modify the script to play healing tones in sequence:

```python
healing_freqs = [3, 5, 7.83, 10, 12, 18, 20]
for f in healing_freqs:
    print(f"Playing {f} Hz")
    tone = 0.5 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * f * t)
    sd.play(tone, samplerate)
    sd.wait()
    time.sleep(1)
```

## ✅ You're Done

You now have a **self-contained healing frequency generator** running on your Pi — no apps, no Wi-Fi required after setup.

You can:

- Automate daily healing routines
- Connect it to a small screen and buttons
- Play entire treatment protocols offline

## 💡 Tip

Try 7.83 Hz (Schumann Resonance) for grounding and 10 Hz for inflammation. Adjust volume **low** for sustained sessions.
