Creating an **environmental monitor** with your Raspberry Pi Pico is a rewarding project that combines sensor integration, data logging, and visualization. This project can measure temperature, humidity, pressure, and air quality — and display or log the data for later analysis.

## 🧰 Components Needed

1. **Raspberry Pi Pico** — The main microcontroller
2. **Environmental Sensors** (choose based on your needs):
   - **BME280 or BME688** — Temperature, humidity, and pressure
   - **MQ135** — Air quality (CO2, NH3, alcohol, benzene, smoke)
   - **DHT22** — Temperature and humidity
3. **Breadboard and Jumper Wires** — For connecting components
4. **Power Supply** — USB cable to power the Pico
5. **MicroSD Card Module** *(optional)* — For logging data
6. **Display** *(optional)* — OLED or LCD to show real-time readings

## 🛠 Step-by-Step Build

### 1. Set Up the Pico

- Install **MicroPython** on your Pico ([official guide](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/micropython.html)).
- Connect the Pico to your computer and open the **Thonny IDE**.

### 2. Connect the Sensors

- Wire the sensors to the Pico using a breadboard and jumper wires.
- Example: The BME280 sensor uses I2C communication — connect it to Pico’s I2C pins.

### 3. Install Required Libraries

- In Thonny, install MicroPython libraries for your chosen sensors.
- For the BME280, use the `bme280` MicroPython library.

### 4. Write the Code

Example MicroPython code for the **BME280**:

```python
import machine
import bme280
import time

i2c = machine.I2C(0, scl=machine.Pin(17), sda=machine.Pin(16))
sensor = bme280.BME280(i2c=i2c)

while True:
    temperature, pressure, humidity = sensor.read_compensated_data()
    print("Temperature:", temperature / 100, "C")
    print("Pressure:", pressure / 25600, "hPa")
    print("Humidity:", humidity / 1024, "%")
    time.sleep(2)
```

### 5. Log or Display Data

- **Logging** — Write readings to a file on a microSD card.
- **Display** — Show real-time data on an OLED or LCD.

### 6. Power the Setup

- Use a USB power bank or wall adapter for portable use.

## 💡 Additional Tips

- **Calibration** — Calibrate sensors for accurate readings.
- **Enclosure** — Protect electronics with a custom case.
- **Cloud Integration** — Send data to a cloud service for remote monitoring.
