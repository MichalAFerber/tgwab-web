If you're tired of ads cluttering your browsing experience across all your devices—from smartphones to smart TVs—it's time to implement network-wide ad blocking. Pi-hole offers an elegant DNS-level solution that blocks ads and trackers for every device on your network without requiring individual software installation. In this guide, I'll walk you through setting up Pi-hole, compare it with AdGuard Home, and explain why Pi-hole has become my go-to choice for homelab DNS management.

## What is Pi-hole?

Pi-hole is a DNS sinkhole that acts as a network-wide ad blocker. Instead of filtering ads at the browser level, Pi-hole intercepts DNS requests from all devices on your network and blocks queries to known advertising and tracking domains before they ever reach your devices.

When a device on your network tries to load an advertisement, Pi-hole checks the domain against its blocklists. If the domain is on the blocklist, Pi-hole returns a non-routable address like `0.0.0.0`, effectively preventing the ad from loading. For legitimate content, Pi-hole forwards the DNS query to your chosen upstream DNS provider and returns the result.

### Key Benefits

**Network-wide protection**: Block ads on all devices including smart TVs, IoT devices, smartphones, and tablets—even those that don't support traditional ad blockers.

**Improved performance**: Pages load faster without ads consuming bandwidth and processing power. Pi-hole also caches DNS queries locally, reducing DNS resolution times.

**Enhanced privacy**: Block tracking domains and analytics services across your entire network, reducing the digital footprint of all your devices.

**Lightweight and efficient**: Runs smoothly on minimal hardware, making it perfect for Raspberry Pi or resource-efficient LXC containers.

**Network insights**: The web dashboard provides detailed statistics about DNS queries, helping you understand what your devices are communicating with.

## Installation on Raspberry Pi

Setting up Pi-hole on a Raspberry Pi is straightforward and takes about 15 minutes.

### Prerequisites

- Raspberry Pi with Raspberry Pi OS installed
- Network connection (Ethernet recommended)
- SSH access or direct console access
- Static IP address for the Pi (configured via router or OS)

### Installation Steps

1. **Update your system:**
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

2. **Assign a static IP address** (if not done via router):
```bash
sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf
```

Add the following lines (adjust for your network):
```
interface eth0
static ip_address=192.168.1.100/24
static routers=192.168.1.1
static domain_name_servers=1.1.1.1 8.8.8.8
```

Reboot to apply changes:
```bash
sudo reboot
```

3. **Run the Pi-hole installer:**
```bash
curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash
```

**Note**: While piping to bash is controversial, this is the official installation method. You can review the script at https://install.pi-hole.net before running it if you prefer.

4. **Follow the installer prompts:**
   - Confirm static IP address setup
   - Select network interface (eth0 for Ethernet, wlan0 for Wi-Fi)
   - Choose upstream DNS provider (Cloudflare 1.1.1.1, Google 8.8.8.8, OpenDNS, etc.)
   - Select default blocklists (recommended: Yes)
   - Install web admin interface (recommended: Yes)
   - Enable query logging (your choice based on privacy preferences)

5. **Save the admin password** displayed at the end of installation. You can change it later with:
```bash
pihole -a -p
```

6. **Access the web interface:**
Navigate to `http://YOUR_PI_IP/admin` (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100/admin`)

### Configure Your Network

To enable network-wide ad blocking, configure your router to use Pi-hole as the DNS server:

1. Log into your router's admin panel
2. Find DHCP/DNS settings
3. Set primary DNS to your Pi-hole IP address
4. Leave secondary DNS blank (or set to a backup Pi-hole)
5. Save and reboot router if necessary

Alternatively, manually configure DNS on individual devices for testing before network-wide deployment.

## Installation on Proxmox LXC

Running Pi-hole in a Proxmox LXC container is my preferred method. LXC containers are lightweight, efficient, and perfectly suited for services like Pi-hole.

### Creating the LXC Container

1. **Download Debian template** (if not already available):

From Proxmox web interface:
- Navigate to your storage (e.g., local)
- Click CT Templates → Templates
- Download Debian 12 (Bookworm)

Or via command line:
```bash
pveam update
pveam download local debian-12-standard_12.2-1_amd64.tar.zst
```

2. **Create the LXC container** via web interface or command line:

**Via command line:**
```bash
pct create 100 local:vztmpl/debian-12-standard_12.2-1_amd64.tar.zst \
  --hostname pihole \
  --memory 512 \
  --cores 1 \
  --rootfs local-lvm:4 \
  --net0 name=eth0,bridge=vmbr0,ip=192.168.1.100/24,gw=192.168.1.1 \
  --unprivileged 1 \
  --features nesting=1 \
  --onboot 1 \
  --start 1
```

**Via web interface:**
- Click Create CT
- General: Set CT ID (e.g., 100), hostname (pihole), password
- Template: Select Debian 12
- Disks: 4GB root disk
- CPU: 1 core
- Memory: 512MB RAM, 512MB Swap
- Network: Static IP (e.g., 192.168.1.100/24), gateway
- DNS: Use host settings
- Check "Start after created"

3. **Install Pi-hole inside the container:**

Access the container console:
```bash
pct enter 100
```

Or SSH into the container:
```bash
ssh root@192.168.1.100
```

Update the system:
```bash
apt update && apt upgrade -y
```

Install curl (required for Pi-hole installer):
```bash
apt install -y curl
```

Run Pi-hole installer:
```bash
curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash
```

Follow the same installation prompts as the Raspberry Pi installation.

4. **Access the web interface:**
Navigate to `http://192.168.1.100/admin`

### Advantages of LXC Deployment

- **Resource efficiency**: LXC containers share the host kernel, using minimal resources
- **Easy backup**: Proxmox makes container backups trivial
- **High availability**: With Proxmox clustering, you can implement automatic failover
- **Multiple instances**: Easy to run multiple Pi-hole instances for redundancy
- **Centralized management**: Control everything from the Proxmox interface

## Post-Installation Configuration

Once Pi-hole is installed, there are several optimizations and configurations worth considering:

### 1. Adding Additional Blocklists

Navigate to Settings → Adlists and add additional blocklists. Some popular options:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenBlack/hosts/master/hosts
https://dbl.oisd.nl
https://v.firebog.net/hosts/lists.php?type=tick
```

After adding lists, update gravity:
```bash
pihole -g
```

### 2. Whitelisting Essential Domains

Some domains may need to be whitelisted to prevent breaking functionality:

- Settings → Whitelist
- Add domains that are incorrectly blocked
- Common examples: update servers, CDN domains, authentication services

### 3. Configuring Upstream DNS

For enhanced privacy, consider using encrypted DNS or recursive DNS with Unbound:

**Using Cloudflare DNS:**
- Settings → DNS → Upstream DNS Servers
- Select Cloudflare (1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1)

**Setting up Unbound** (recursive DNS):
```bash
apt install -y unbound
curl -o /etc/unbound/unbound.conf.d/pi-hole.conf https://docs.pi-hole.net/guides/dns/unbound/
systemctl restart unbound
```

Then configure Pi-hole to use Unbound:
- Settings → DNS → Upstream DNS Servers
- Custom 1: `127.0.0.1#5353`
- Uncheck all other upstream servers

### 4. Enable DHCP (Optional)

If your router's DHCP server is limited, Pi-hole can act as your DHCP server:

- Settings → DHCP
- Enable DHCP server
- Configure IP range, router/gateway, and domain
- **Important**: Disable DHCP on your router first

### 5. Local DNS Records

Add local DNS entries for your homelab services:

- Local DNS → DNS Records
- Add domain names and corresponding IP addresses
- Example: `proxmox.home.lab` → `192.168.1.10`

This eliminates the need to remember IP addresses for your homelab services.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Web Dashboard

The Pi-hole dashboard provides comprehensive statistics:

- Total queries
- Queries blocked (percentage)
- Top blocked domains
- Top clients
- Query types
- Forwarding destinations

### Command-Line Tools

Pi-hole includes powerful CLI tools:

```bash
# Update Pi-hole
pihole -up

# Update blocklists
pihole -g

# Restart Pi-hole services
pihole restartdns

# View real-time logs
pihole -t

# Check status
pihole status

# Disable blocking temporarily (in seconds)
pihole disable 300

# Re-enable blocking
pihole enable

# Change web password
pihole -a -p
```

### Regular Maintenance

- **Update Pi-hole**: Run `pihole -up` monthly
- **Update blocklists**: Automatic by default (weekly), or manually with `pihole -g`
- **Review statistics**: Identify blocked domains that might need whitelisting
- **Backup configuration**: Export your settings regularly

## Redundancy and High Availability

For critical homelab infrastructure, consider running two Pi-hole instances:

### Primary and Secondary Setup

1. Install Pi-hole on two separate devices/containers
2. Configure router to use both as DNS servers:
   - Primary DNS: Pi-hole 1 (192.168.1.100)
   - Secondary DNS: Pi-hole 2 (192.168.1.101)

### Keeping Instances in Sync

Use **Gravity Sync** to synchronize configurations between Pi-holes:

```bash
# On both Pi-hole instances
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vmstan/gravity-sync/master/GS_INSTALL.sh | bash
```

Configure gravity-sync to sync:
- Blocklists
- Whitelists
- Blacklists
- Local DNS records
- DHCP settings

This ensures you only need to manage one Pi-hole while maintaining redundancy.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Websites Not Loading

**Problem**: Legitimate websites fail to load or function properly.

**Solution**: 
- Check query log to identify blocked domains
- Whitelist necessary domains
- Temporarily disable Pi-hole (`pihole disable 300`) to confirm it's the cause

### High False Positive Rate

**Problem**: Too many legitimate domains are blocked.

**Solution**:
- Review and adjust blocklists
- Remove aggressive blocklists
- Use more curated lists like OISD

### Pi-hole Not Blocking Ads

**Problem**: Ads still appear on some websites.

**Solution**:
- Verify devices are using Pi-hole as DNS (check router settings)
- Some ads are served from the same domain as content (YouTube, Hulu)
- Update blocklists: `pihole -g`
- Check if domains are on whitelist

### YouTube Ads Still Showing

**Problem**: Pi-hole doesn't block YouTube ads.

**Limitation**: YouTube serves ads from the same domains as content, making DNS-level blocking impossible without breaking functionality. Solutions:
- Use browser extensions like uBlock Origin
- Consider YouTube Premium
- Accept that DNS blocking has limitations

## Performance Considerations

Pi-hole is remarkably efficient, but there are ways to optimize performance:

### DNS Caching

Pi-hole caches DNS responses, significantly speeding up repeat queries. You can monitor cache effectiveness in the dashboard.

### Rate Limiting

Configure rate limiting to prevent DNS amplification attacks:

Edit `/etc/dnsmasq.d/02-pihole-rate-limit.conf`:
```
rate-limit=1000/60/60
```

### Log Management

Query logging can impact performance on high-traffic networks. Consider:
- Reducing log retention period
- Disabling logging if privacy is paramount
- Using anonymous mode (logs without client identification)

## Security Best Practices

1. **Change default password immediately** after installation
2. **Enable HTTPS** for the web interface (requires certificate setup)
3. **Restrict web interface access** to local network only
4. **Keep Pi-hole updated** with `pihole -up`
5. **Use strong upstream DNS providers** (Cloudflare, Quad9)
6. **Consider recursive DNS** (Unbound) for maximum privacy
7. **Regular backups** of configuration via teleporter (Settings → Teleporter)

## Integration with Other Homelab Services

Pi-hole integrates seamlessly with homelab infrastructure:

### Unbound (Recursive DNS)

Eliminate reliance on external DNS providers by resolving DNS queries yourself.
