## **How to Build a Raspberry Pi Camera for Seamless WebRTC Streaming**

I recently completed a project using the Pi Zero 2 W and the Camera Module 3. My goal was to stream a live feed from the camera and use WebRTC to integrate it with HTML. After some trial and error, I found MediaMTX to be the best package for WebRTC. I wouldn't have been able to do this without stumbling upon a helpful Reddit post.

## Hardware & Operating System

- **Pi Zero 2 W**
- **Pi Camera Module 3**
- **Pi 12.5W Micro USB Power Supply**
- **Pi Zero Case**
- **SanDisk Extreme PRO SDHC And SDXC UHS-I Card**
- **Pi OS Lite (32-bit)**

| Making it all work

## 1. Set up your SD card using Raspberry Pi Imager

- **Device:** Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W
- **OS:** Raspberry Pi OS (other) -> Raspberry Pi OS Lite (32-bit) (Bookworm, No GUI)
- Configure settings to set up your user/pass and SSID for Wi-Fi.

## 2. After the first boot, update your Pi

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt full-upgrade
```

## 3. Install the libcamera apps (drivers for the camera)

```bash
sudo apt install libcamera-apps
```

## 4. Test to ensure the camera is recognized by the Pi

```bash
libcamera-hello --list-cameras
```

You should see output similar to this:

## 5. Download and uncompress MediaMTX

```bash
wget https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/releases/download/v1.9.0/mediamtx_v1.9.0_linux_armv7.tar.gz
tar -xvzf mediamtx_v1.9.0_linux_armv7.tar.gz
```

## 6. Remove the LICENSE file (make sure to read it first): (optional)

```javascript
sudo rm -rf LICENSE
```

## 7. Move the files to the correct locations and set permissions

```javascript
sudo mv mediamtx /usr/local/bin/
sudo mv mediamtx.yml /usr/local/etc/
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/mediamtx
```

## 8. Modify the YAML configuration file

```bash
sudo nano /usr/local/etc/mediamtx.yml
```

Scroll to the bottom and add the following under `paths:`  

```bash
paths:
  cam:
    source: rpiCamera
```

Ensure proper indentation (2 spaces per level). Save and exit nano (`Ctrl + o`, `Enter`, `Ctrl + x`).

| Optional
| I also change `rpiCameraTextOverlayEnable = true` and I set a description in the `rpiCameraTextOverlay`. These settings are just above the paths in the rpi section. You can refer to the documentation for this.

## 9. Set up the service file

```bash
sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/mediamtx.service >/dev/null << EOF
[Unit]
Wants=network.target
[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/mediamtx /usr/local/etc/mediamtx.yml
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
```

## 10. Set up the daemon, enable the service, start the service, and check its status

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable mediamtx
sudo systemctl start mediamtx
sudo systemctl status mediamtx
```

The status output should look something like this:

![WebRTC streaming service status output](https://i.ibb.co/WfwyDXc/service-status.png)

## 11. If you encounter any errors, check the service log file

```javascript
sudo journalctl -u mediamtx.service
```

## 12. Verify everything is working by visiting

```bash
http://yourIPaddress:8889/cam
```

You should see a live video feed.

Hope this helps!
