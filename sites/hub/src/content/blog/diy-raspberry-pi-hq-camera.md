This project walks you through building a **portable, high-quality camera** using the Raspberry Pi HQ Camera module, Pi Zero WH, and a compact display. The result is a battery-powered camera system with a live view, perfect for experimentation, photography, and maker projects.

## 🧰 Components

1. **Raspberry Pi Zero WH (Zero W with Headers)**
2. **Raspberry Pi High Quality HQ Camera - 12MP**
3. **16mm 10MP Telephoto Lens for Raspberry Pi HQ Camera**
4. **Raspberry Pi Zero v1.3 Camera Cable**
5. **Adafruit Mini PiTFT 1.3" - 240x240 TFT Add-on for Raspberry Pi**
6. **Lithium Ion Cylindrical Battery - 3.7v 2200mAh**
7. **Power management board or charger** (e.g., Adafruit PowerBoost 1000 Basic)

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Build

### 1. Assemble the Camera

- Connect the **Raspberry Pi HQ Camera** to the Pi Zero using the camera cable.
- Attach the **telephoto lens** to the camera.

### 2. Connect the Display

- Attach the **Mini PiTFT display** to the GPIO pins on the Pi Zero.
- This display will show the live feed from the camera.

### 3. Power Setup

- Connect the Lithium Ion battery to a **power management board** (PowerBoost 1000 Basic recommended).
- This ensures a stable power supply to the Pi Zero.

### 4. Software Setup

- **Install Raspberry Pi OS** (Lite or Full) using [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/).
- Enable the camera interface:

```bash
sudo raspi-config
```

- Install PiTFT display drivers (instructions on [Adafruit’s site](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-mini-pitft-1-3-color-tft-add-on-for-raspberry-pi)).
- Use `raspistill` or `raspivid` for images/videos, or Python’s `PiCamera` for scripting.

### 5. Build the Enclosure

- Design and 3D print, or repurpose a small project box to fit the Pi, battery, camera, and display.

### 6. Testing and Tweaks

- Test the live view and image capture.
- Adjust camera settings for lighting and desired image quality.

## 💡 Additional Tips

- **Battery Life**: Track runtime and consider a higher-capacity battery if needed.
- **User Interface**: Build a simple GUI with Python + Tkinter to control camera settings.
