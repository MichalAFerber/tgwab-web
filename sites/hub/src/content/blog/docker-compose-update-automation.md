If you're running a homelab with multiple Docker Compose services, you know the drill: checking for updates, pulling new images, restarting containers, and repeating this process for each service. It's tedious, time-consuming, and frankly, boring work that begs to be automated.

I run about a dozen Docker Compose services on my Ubuntu server—everything from Uptime Kuma for monitoring to Nginx Proxy Manager for reverse proxy duties. Each service sits in its own directory with its own `docker-compose.yml` file. Keeping them all updated manually? No thanks.

So I built a shell script that does it all automatically. And because I believe in the principle of "test before you execute," I added a dry-run mode so you can preview changes before committing to them.

## The Problem

Here's what my home directory looks like:

```bash
~/apprise/
~/bentopdf/
~/donetick/
~/homebox/
~/it-tools/
~/mp3-player/
~/nginx/
~/npm/
~/omni-tools/
~/speedtest/
~/uptime-kuma/
~/vert/
```

Each directory contains a `docker-compose.yml` file that defines one or more services. To update them all manually, I'd need to:

1. `cd` into each directory
2. Run `docker compose pull` to get the latest images
3. Run `docker compose up -d` to restart with new images
4. Repeat for every single service

That's 36+ commands for 12 services. And that's assuming nothing goes wrong.

## The Solution

I created a bash script that automates the entire process. It loops through every directory in my home folder, checks for a `docker-compose.yml` file, and if found, pulls the latest images and restarts the containers.

Here's the complete script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Docker Compose Update Script
# Updates images and restarts containers for all docker-compose.yml projects

set -euo pipefail

# Configuration
LOG_FILE="${HOME}/docker-update-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).log"
BASE_DIR="${HOME}"
DRY_RUN=false

# Colors for output
RED='\033[0;31m'
GREEN='\033[0;32m'
YELLOW='\033[1;33m'
BLUE='\033[0;34m'
NC='\033[0m' # No Color

# Parse command line arguments
while [[ $# -gt 0 ]]; do
    case $1 in
        --dry-run|-n)
            DRY_RUN=true
            shift
            ;;
        --help|-h)
            echo "Usage: $0 [OPTIONS]"
            echo ""
            echo "Options:"
            echo "  --dry-run, -n    Show what would be updated without making changes"
            echo "  --help, -h       Show this help message"
            echo ""
            echo "Examples:"
            echo "  $0              # Update all Docker Compose projects"
            echo "  $0 --dry-run    # Preview updates without making changes"
            exit 0
            ;;
        *)
            echo "Unknown option: $1"
            echo "Use --help for usage information"
            exit 1
            ;;
    esac
done

## Key Features

### 1. Auto-Detection of Docker Compose Command

The script automatically detects whether you're using the old `docker-compose` command or the newer `docker compose` syntax:

```bash
if docker compose version &> /dev/null 2>&1; then
    COMPOSE_CMD="docker compose"
else
    COMPOSE_CMD="docker-compose"
fi
```

This ensures compatibility regardless of your Docker installation.

### 2. Dry-Run Mode

Before making any changes, you can preview what would happen:

```bash
~/update-docker-compose.sh --dry-run
```

This shows you which services would be updated and which images would be pulled, without actually making any changes. It's a safety net that lets you verify everything looks correct before committing.

### 3. Comprehensive Logging

Every run creates a timestamped log file with complete details:

```bash
LOG_FILE="${HOME}/docker-update-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).log"
```

The output goes both to your terminal and to the log file, so you have a permanent record of what happened.

### 4. Color-Coded Output

The script uses color coding for easy scanning:
- 🟢 Green for successful operations
- 🔴 Red for errors
- 🟡 Yellow for warnings
- 🔵 Blue for informational messages

### 5. Error Handling

The script uses `set -euo pipefail` for robust error handling, and continues processing other services even if one fails. At the end, it provides a summary showing how many succeeded and how many failed.

### 6. Support for Both `.yml` and `.yaml` Extensions

Some people prefer `docker-compose.yml`, others use `docker-compose.yaml`. The script handles both:

```bash
if [[ -f "${dir}/docker-compose.yml" ]] || [[ -f "${dir}/docker-compose.yaml" ]]; then
    COMPOSE_FILE="${dir}/docker-compose.yml"
    [[ -f "${dir}/docker-compose.yaml" ]] && COMPOSE_FILE="${dir}/docker-compose.yaml"
    # ... process the file
fi
```

## Installation

1. Save the script to your home directory:

```bash
nano ~/update-docker-compose.sh
```

2. Paste the script content and save it.

3. Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x ~/update-docker-compose.sh
```

## Usage Examples

### Preview Updates (Dry Run)

```bash
~/update-docker-compose.sh --dry-run
```

This shows you what would be updated without making any changes.

### Run the Updates

```bash
~/update-docker-compose.sh
```

This actually pulls new images and restarts containers.

### Get Help

```bash
~/update-docker-compose.sh --help
```

## Real-World Results

Here's what a typical run looks like on my system:

```
[2026-02-01 07:41:49] Starting Docker Compose update process
[2026-02-01 07:41:49] Using compose command: docker compose
[2026-02-01 07:41:49] Log file: /home/michal/docker-update-20260201-074149.log

... [10 more services] ...

[2026-02-01 07:42:15] Log file saved to: /home/michal/docker-update-20260201-074149.log
=========================================
```

All 12 services updated in about 30 seconds. What used to take me 10 minutes of manual work now happens automatically.

## Automating with Cron

Want to run this automatically every week? Add it to your crontab:

```bash
crontab -e
```

Add this line to run it every Sunday at 2 AM:

```cron
0 2 * * 0 ~/update-docker-compose.sh >> ~/docker-updates-cron.log 2>&1
```

Or run it every night at 3 AM:

```cron
0 3 * * * ~/update-docker-compose.sh >> ~/docker-updates-cron.log 2>&1
```

## Optional Enhancement: Better Image Parsing

For more detailed dry-run output, you can install `yq` (a YAML parser):

```bash
sudo wget -qO /usr/local/bin/yq https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/releases/latest/download/yq_linux_amd64
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/yq
```

With `yq` installed, the dry-run mode will show you exactly which images would be updated for each service. Without it, the script falls back to grep-based parsing, which still works but is less precise.

## Why This Approach Works

1. **Transparent**: You can see exactly what's happening at each step
2. **Debuggable**: Comprehensive logs make troubleshooting easy
3. **Safe**: Dry-run mode lets you preview changes first
4. **Minimal cognitive overhead**: Set it and forget it
5. **No external dependencies**: Pure bash with Docker

This is exactly the kind of automation that makes homelab management sustainable. Instead of dreading the update process, I can run a single command (or let cron do it) and move on with my day.

## Conclusion

Managing multiple Docker Compose services doesn't have to be tedious. This script handles all the repetitive work while giving you full visibility and control over the process.

The beauty of this approach is its simplicity. It's just a bash script—no complex orchestration tools, no additional services to maintain. It does one thing well: keeps your Docker containers up to date.

If you're running a homelab with multiple services, give this script a try. It's saved me countless hours of manual updates, and the dry-run mode gives me confidence that nothing unexpected will happen.

Happy homelabbing!
