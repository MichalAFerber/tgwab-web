**VisionPay** is a concept project that merges AI, blockchain, and computer vision into a secure and intelligent payment platform. It leverages the **Raspberry Pi 5**, a **Hailo AI acceleration module**, and a **camera module** to process transactions in real-time while recording them on a blockchain.

## 🛠 Hardware Setup

- **Raspberry Pi 5** (8GB recommended)
- **Hailo AI Acceleration Module** (Hailo-8 or Hailo-8L)
- **Raspberry Pi Camera Module** (Camera Module 3 or High-Quality Camera)
- Optional: Additional hardware for blockchain node hosting

## ⚙️ Software Setup

- **Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit)** — Install via Raspberry Pi Imager.
- **Update System**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt full-upgrade
```

- **Set PCIe to Gen3** for optimal AI performance.
- **Hailo SDK** — Install from the [Hailo GitHub repository](https://github.com/hailo-ai/hailo-rpi5-examples).
- **Python API** — Use the Hailo Python API for AI inference.

## 📷 Camera Configuration

Follow the [Raspberry Pi Camera Guide](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/how-to-set-up-the-raspberry-pi-ai-kit-with-raspberry-pi-5/) to connect and enable the camera module.

## 🤖 AI + Blockchain Workflow

- **Capture Data** — Camera captures images of transactions or QR codes.
- **AI Processing** — Hailo module processes object detection, QR scanning, or identity verification.
- **Blockchain Recording** — Transactions are recorded immutably using a blockchain ledger.

Example Python snippet for detection + blockchain logging:

```python
import cv2
import hailo_sdk
from flask import Flask, jsonify

hailo = hailo_sdk.Hailo()
app = Flask(__name__)
blockchain = []

@app.route('/detect', methods=['POST'])
def detect():
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    cap.release()
    detections = hailo.detect(frame)
    block = {'index': len(blockchain)+1, 'detections': detections}
    blockchain.append(block)
    return jsonify(block)

app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```

## 💳 Payment Integration

- **QR Code Capture** — Using OpenCV + Pyzbar to read QR payment codes.
- **Blockchain Ledger** — Store transactions for transparency and immutability.
- **Smart Contracts** — Automate transaction validation and payment release.

## 🌍 Blockchain Options

- **XRP (Ripple)** — Fast cross-border transactions with low fees.
- **XLM (Stellar)** — Low-cost payments and asset tokenization support.
- **Ethereum / Polygon** — Smart contract flexibility.

## 📈 Potential Use Cases

- Retail & Point-of-Sale payments
- Peer-to-peer microtransactions
- Cross-border remittances
- Automated contract-based billing

## 📝 Executive Summary

**VisionPay** is positioned to become a next-gen payment platform by:

- Leveraging **AI** for real-time verification.
- Using **blockchain** for transparency and security.
- Supporting **fast, low-cost payments** via XRP, XLM, or other networks.

This concept represents a **future-ready fintech solution** where AI meets secure, decentralized payments.
